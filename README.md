# Analysis of a public online retail data set.

The Jupyter notebook stored in this repository is the output of a couple of days of exploratory
data analysis of an online retail data set.  The purpose was to see what value could be extracted
from a fairly large and open-ended dataset (as opposed to one of the more straight forward Kaggle
data sets with a more obvious target vector, for example).

The analysis includes some basic feature engineering and machine learning. I also used the
opportunity to test Microsoft's LightGBM algorithm - I didn't have access to high performance
computing resource and the algorithm served me well in terms of speed and accuracy, compared with
XGBoost).

## ToDo:

 * complete the NLP section to build categories for the free test description of items.
 * build some better features and make some better predictions!
